# Audio samples from "DiDiSpeech: A Large Scale Mandarin Speech Corpus"
**Abstract** This paper introduces a new open-sourced Mandarin speech corpus, called DiDiSpeech. It consists of about 800 hours of speech data at 48kHz sampling rate from 6000 speakers and the corresponding texts. All speech data in the corpus was recorded in quiet environment and is suitable for various speech processing tasks, such as voice conversion, multi-speaker text-to-speech and aucomatic speech recognation. We conduct experiments with multiple speech tasks and evaluate the performance, showing that it is promising to use the corpus for both academic research and practical application. The corpus is available at https://outreach.didichuxing.com/research/opendata/en/.

**Note** The speech data of 500 speakers selected from the DiDiSpeech-1 corpus and the corresponding texts will be available at https://outreach.didichuxing.com/research/opendata/en/ on 24 October 2020 on SLIMTS2020 Workshop (https://outreach.didichuxing.com/internationalconference/interspeech2020/). The complete DiDiSpeech corpus will be released step by step.
